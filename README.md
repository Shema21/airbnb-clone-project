🧩 Feature Breakdown
This project replicates essential functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Each feature is designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience, whether they are guests or hosts.

🔐 User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. There are role distinctions between guests and hosts, and each user has a personalized dashboard to manage bookings or listings.

🏠 Property Management
Hosts can list properties by providing details such as title, description, price, and location. They can also edit or delete listings and view booking requests for their properties.

📅 Booking System
Guests can view available listings and book properties for selected dates. The system calculates the total price based on the length of stay and handles overlapping reservations.

💳 Payment Processing (Planned)
A secure payment system will allow guests to pay for bookings directly through the platform. This includes handling transactions, confirming payment, and linking them to bookings.

⭐ Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and star ratings after their stay. This builds trust and helps future users make informed decisions about properties.

🔍 Search and Filtering
Users can search for listings based on location, price, and availability. Filtering helps users quickly find properties that meet their specific needs.

⚙️ Admin Dashboard
Admins have access to a backend panel where they can manage users, listings, bookings, and reports. This ensures proper moderation and control over platform content.

🔐 API Security
Securing the backend APIs is essential for protecting user data, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining the integrity of the platform. The following security measures will be implemented in this project:

🔑 Authentication
Only registered users can access protected endpoints by providing valid login credentials. Django’s built-in authentication system or token-based methods (e.g., JWT) will be used to verify identities.
Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information or functionality.

🛡️ Authorization
Access control rules will ensure that users can only perform actions they are permitted to—e.g., a host can edit their own listings, but not others’.
Why it matters: Protects data integrity by restricting users from manipulating data they don’t own.

🚫 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting helps prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe.
Why it matters: Helps mitigate brute-force attacks and protects the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

🔒 HTTPS & Secure Sessions
All data transmission will be encrypted using HTTPS, and secure cookie settings will be used to maintain safe sessions.
Why it matters: Protects user credentials, session tokens, and payment data during transit.

💬 Input Validation and Sanitization
User input will be validated on both frontend and backend to prevent injection attacks and malformed data.
Why it matters: Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

💳 Secure Payments (Planned)
Payment APIs will integrate with trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) that comply with PCI-DSS standards.
Why it matters: Ensures that financial transactions are processed securely and sensitive payment data is not exposed.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Every time code is pushed to the repository, automated pipelines ensure that the changes are validated and safely deployed.

Why It's Important
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline helps maintain code quality, reduces the chances of bugs reaching production, and speeds up the development lifecycle. It ensures consistent deployments, simplifies collaboration between developers, and allows quick detection of issues through automated tests.

Tools for CI/CD
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows like running tests, linting code, and deploying apps directly from GitHub.

Docker: Provides containerized environments for consistent builds and deployments across different systems.

Heroku / AWS / Render (Deployment Targets): Can be integrated into the pipeline for auto-deploying successful builds.

pytest / unittest (Testing Tools): Used to validate functionality before deployment.
