üè° Airbnb Clone
Overview
This is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform, built using Django. The project replicates core features of Airbnb, including user registration, listing properties, searching for stays, and booking. It's a full-stack web application aimed at understanding how to structure and develop scalable web apps using Django.

Project Goals
  1. Understand and implement Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.
  
  2. Practice working with relational databases using Django ORM.
  
  3. Build reusable Django apps (e.g., users, listings, reservations).
  
  4. Gain experience with user authentication and session management.
  
  5. Create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  
  Tech Stack
  1. Backend Framework: Django (Python)
  
  2. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally Bootstrap for styling)
  
  3. Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for production-ready deployment)
  
      Other Tools:
      
      1. Django Admin for backend management
      
      2. Django REST Framework (optional, if adding API endpoints)
      
      3. Git for version control

Features
